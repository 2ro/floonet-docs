# WooCommerce quick start

> **Summary.** Take Grin payments on a WooCommerce store in four steps: run the GoblinPay till on your own server, install the plugin, paste three values, test.

You run the [GoblinPay till](README.md) on your own server, then paste three values into WooCommerce.

## 1. Install GoblinPay and run the wizard

On your server (a small Linux box is plenty):

```bash
sudo ./deploy/install.sh     # builds + installs the binary and unit, then offers the wizard
# or, if GoblinPay is already installed:
sudo gp-server setup
```

The [wizard](README.md#setup-the-wizard-recommended-path) asks a few questions (all with defaults) and does the rest: it makes your till wallet, generates every secret, picks a healthy Grin node, and writes the config. Two answers matter for WooCommerce:

- **Your till URL**: either a subdomain like `https://pay.myshop.com`, or a path on your existing shop domain like `https://myshop.com/pay` if you would rather not add a DNS record (see [Hosting](hosting.md)).
- **Your shop URL**: `https://myshop.com`. The wizard turns this into your webhook URL for you.

When it finishes it prints three values and a webhook URL. Keep that screen. Then start the till:

```bash
sudo systemctl start gp-server
```

## 2. Install the plugin

Download `goblinpay-woocommerce.zip` (a GoblinPay release artifact; you can also build it yourself with `deploy/package-woocommerce.sh`). In WordPress:

**Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin →** choose the zip **→ Install → Activate.**

## 3. Paste the three values

**WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → GoblinPay (Grin) → Manage:**

| Field | Paste |
|---|---|
| GoblinPay URL | your till URL (e.g. `https://pay.myshop.com`) |
| API Token | the `gp_live_…` value from the wizard |
| Webhook Secret | the `whsec_…` value from the wizard |
| Matching mode | Per-invoice identity (recommended) |

Tick **Enable Grin payments via GoblinPay** and **Save changes**. The wizard already pointed the till's webhook at your shop, so nothing else to wire.

## 4. Test a payment

Place a test order and choose the Grin method at checkout. You are shown a QR (or redirected to the hosted checkout). Pay it from your [Goblin wallet](https://goblin.st): scan, approve, done. The order moves to **processing** once the payment confirms on chain (default 10 confirmations).

Watch **WooCommerce → Status → Logs** (source `goblinpay`) if you enabled debug logging, or the till's own admin dashboard, to follow the payment.

## Notes

- **Refunds** are manual: GoblinPay is receive-only, so refund a customer by sending Grin back from your wallet.
- **Run the till hot but light:** it has its own seed, so keep only a small working balance on it and sweep to your main wallet regularly.
- For the full plugin reference see `connectors/woocommerce/INSTALL.md` in the GoblinPay repo.
